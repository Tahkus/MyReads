# MyReads Project

This is a project from Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program, and is part of the Building With React course.
Udacity provided static examples of the CSS and HTML markup to be used, as well as the BooksAPI and the backend server configurations. 
The student had to create all React code to get the app working correctly.

## To Get Started

You will need to:
* Clone/download this repository.
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## What The App Does

Once the app is running in your browser you will be able to sort the books by three categories: Currently Reading, 
Want to Read, and Already Read. You can change the shelf of each book, and click through to a search page
in order to find new books to add to your shelves.
